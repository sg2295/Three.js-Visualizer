# Three.js Visualizer
## About ðŸ“œ
Developed, documented, and tested a graphics interaction system.
The final implementation included a total of 5 models, 4 of which were capable of moving around in the environment, a controllable skybox, and lighting options. Additionally, in this project I attempted to recreate the realistic movement of two aircraft, by manipulating their rigid 3D objects using mathematics.
## Learning Outcomes ðŸ“š
- Developed code capable of interacting with JavaScript events. 
- Tested and documented a graphics interaction system. 
- Recreated many of the existing Three.js controls, including orbit camera controls, using low-level functions/resources. 
- Manipulated 3D Objects using mathematical operations.
