# Three.js Visualizer
### About
Developed, documented, and tested a graphics interaction system.
The final implementation included a total of 5 models, 4 of which were capable of moving around in the environment, a controllable skybox, and lighting options. Additionally, in this project I attempted to recreate the realistic movement of two aircraft, by manipulating their rigid 3D objects using mathematics.
### Learning Outcomes
- Developed code capable of interacting with JavaScript events. 
- Tested and documented a graphics interaction system. 
- Recreated many of the existing Three.js controls, including orbit camera controls, using low-level functions/resources. 
- Manipulated 3D Objects using mathematical operations.

> Please note that it takes some time to load all the 3D Objects/Models used
### Controls
Key Binding | Event
------------|------
[1],[2],[3] | Rotate Cube/Model about -x, -y, -z axis
[E],[V],[F] | Change Render Mode (Edges, Vertices, Face)
[W],[A],[S],[D] & arrow keys |  Move the Camera
[Mouse Button] | Orbit the camera about an arbitrary point
[N] | Show the Cube's outline and the Model fit inside it
[M] | Toggle between the Cube/Model Modes
